This is a PostgreSQL database project for the Engineering School at the University of Ghana. It contains tables, views, indexes, and functions that store and process data related to the courses, students, faculty, staff, and facilities of the school.
Prerequisites

Before you can use this database, you need to have the following software installed on your computer:

    PostgreSQL database server (version 13 or higher)
    pgAdmin or other PostgreSQL client tools

You also need to have the following credentials to access the database:

    username
    password
    database name
    host name or IP address
    port number

You can obtain these credentials from the database administrator or the setup script.
Installation

To install this database, follow these steps:

    Download or clone this repository to your computer.
    Open pgAdmin or another PostgreSQL client tool.
    Connect to the PostgreSQL database server using the credentials mentioned above.
    Create a new empty database with the same name as the database in the credentials.
    Open the SQL script file engineering_school.sql in pgAdmin or another PostgreSQL client tool.
    Execute the SQL script by clicking on the "Execute" button or by pressing the F5 key.
    Wait for the script to complete without errors. If errors occur, review the log and fix the issues.
    Verify that the database is populated with the expected data by querying the tables and views using SQL statements.

Usage

To use this database, you can perform the following tasks:

    Insert new data into the tables using the INSERT statement.
    Update existing data in the tables using the UPDATE statement.
    Delete data from the tables using the DELETE statement.
    Query the data from the tables using the SELECT statement.
    Create new views based on the tables using the CREATE VIEW statement.
    Modify existing views using the ALTER VIEW statement.
    Drop views using the DROP VIEW statement.
    Create indexes on the tables using the CREATE INDEX statement.
    Modify indexes using the ALTER INDEX statement.
    Drop indexes using the DROP INDEX statement.
    Create functions using the CREATE FUNCTION statement.
    Modify functions using the ALTER FUNCTION statement.
    Drop functions using the DROP FUNCTION statement.

You can find more information about these tasks in the PostgreSQL documentation or other online resources.
